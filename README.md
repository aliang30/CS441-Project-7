Android Studio Application 
Project 7 Description (README)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

For project 7, I continued building on from project 6's game by utilizing more of Android Studio's features. This time I added a difficulty setting for the actual game. While I was playing the game, I noticed that adding a difficulty setting could come in handy if the player wants a real challenge. The difficulty setting consists of both easy and hard. I modified my code to make it seem like the vehicle is moving much faster than before for the hard difficulty setting. I also decided to add an extra add-on to the game (which is essentially a quiz to test the player's knowledge in cars). I decided to add extra activities that can be access from the actual game's main menu screen and once you click on "Test your Knowledge", you will be taken to the quiz main menu. I created an instruction page that says that you are simply taking a simple multiple choice question quiz and when you are given a picture, you will have to select the correct car name of the vehicle shown in the picture. I had fun creating this since I had to work with arraylists and alert popups. Also, I found working with data in Android Studio to be quite interesting. In the end, I decided to put a result screen which shows the player's score for the quiz.
